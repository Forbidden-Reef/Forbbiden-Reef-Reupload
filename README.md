## Forbidden-Reef
This is a team project made by Samantha Simpson, Pasindu Siriwardena, and Stewart Mckenzie for our 3D Computer Game Programming course at Cal State Los Angeles.

A pilot, shaman, and survivalist were on their way to investigate an uncharted ring
of islands when a storm causes their plane to crash in the ocean. They each notice fog rolling in towards the shore and hear an ominous singing catching the wind. They search the beach for clues, artifacts, and each other, but once the fog reaches the coast, lost souls swarm the beach, pushing them inward. While heading in, they come upon a simple villager from the island. They learn the island is being attacked by Sirens that kidnap humans, lock them in an underwater reef where soul steelers come, and capture their soul for the Leviathan. On another island, a Leviathan is holding hostage all the souls of those kidnapped. You must create a boat and weapons to venture out to sea and save the people on the island before it is too late. However, beware as there are enemies in the ocean with beautiful tails but piercing songs and whirlpools that will take you under and spit you back out. Create armor and weapons along your journey as the trek across the sea, you slay beasts of all kinds and finally battle the king of the ocean.

## Motivation
We are tasked with creating a game that does not rely on human violence to be engaging and fun. Our target audience is our professors' children and game lovers.
